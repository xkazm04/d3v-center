Here are 5 DeFi Native Token Distribution Mechanisms:
|Launch mechanism|Protocol  |Permissionless|
|----------------|----------|--------------|
|Initial listing | Uniswap  | |
|Mesa Offering   | Gnosis   | |
|Liquidity mining| | |
|Retroactive airdrop| | |
|Liquidity bootstrapping| Balancer| |

# Launch goal
- **Incentivize liquidity pools**
- **Decntralized distribution** - more holders = more stability
- **Generate treasury backed liquidity**

## 1. Initial DEX offerings (IDO)
## 2. Dutch auctions
## 3. Liquidity mining
## 4. Lockdrop
## 5. Launchpads

*note: DeFi projects need liquidity and capital to get started, and incentivizing community members for bootstrapping TVL is the most common strategy.*

# Token distribution
|Stakeholder group| Description| Examples| Average allocation in 2021 - TVD ref|

Project types create distinct token allocations due to the different needs of the business.
**Gaming projects** also aggressively invest in early player growth and community engagement, as the quality of the project is heavily dependent on the number of players and gamers in the ecosystem.
**Infrastructure projects** (e.g., ENS, Biconomy, Radicle, and API3) tend to allocate more tokens to the core team members and company/treasury fund, likely due to providing immediate utility without relying on sufficient
liquidity or game players.
