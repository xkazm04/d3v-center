# DAO Proposal structure TBD Index coop
[Reference](https://aragon.org/how-to/structure-dao-proposals-and-build-proposal-processes)
A DAO proposal is an idea that a community or DAO member wants the DAO to consider. It’s typically a document describing an idea, how it will be implemented, and the funding requirements for executing the idea.

Proposals should be fully-formed ideas that have exited the brainstorming phase and are ready for the community to evaluate. An example of a proposal would be “Create a Treasury management core team” or “Develop a new onboarding process for new members.”

The DAO likely has a forum where they post proposals up for discussion before moving to an official vote on a voting platform. This forum is usually held on [Discourse](https://www.discourse.org), where contributors need to create an account to be able to comment and vote on proposals. Think of the forum as the town square where ideas are discussed and debated, and the on-chain voting platform as the poll box where contributors cast their final, official vote.

## Proposal process
A proposal process includes the steps required to take a proposal from ideation to execution. The process you choose ultimately depends on what works for you and your community. 
The final process will likely look like a series of steps. 
1. Flesh out the idea
2. Gather your team
3. Post the proposal on a forum for feedback
4. Post a second draft of the proposal if major edits are required
5. Post the proposal for an official vote on your DAO’s voting platform


## Proposal template
The best way to standardize your structure across the DAO is to provide a copy-paste template in an easy-to-find place, such as a pinned Discourse post or a prominent Notion page.
