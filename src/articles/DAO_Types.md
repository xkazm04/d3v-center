There are different types of DAO. Here, we will look at the different categories that a decentralized autonomous organization can fall into, based on its mode of operation, structure, and even technology.

## 1. DeFi Protocol DAO
These DAOs use smart contract protocols to bring DeFi (decentralized financial) services to their users. They use tokens as voting means to implement the protocol and financial changes. 
- Examples: Uniswap, Aave, Maker DAO, Olympus DAO

## 2. Investment DAO
A group of people, letâ€™s call them investors, pool their money together and make investment decisions. These decisions could include investing in start-ups or artworks. Investment DAOs support capital pooling for various DeFi operations.
- Examples: Meta Cartel DAO, LAO

## 3. Grant DAO
In a grant DAO, members of the community donate funds into the grant pool, and they vote on how to allocate and distribute the funds. These DAOs are in charge of funding new innovative DeFi projects. The organizations that need funding just need to submit applications.
- Examples: Gitcoin, Moloch DAO, Seedify
  
## 4. Collector DAO
Organizations with focus on the purchase of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) or other artworks and collectibles.
- Pleasr DAO, Constitution DAO, Flamingo DAO

## 5. Social DAO
Platforms for social interactions and social networking. 
- Friends with benefits, Ape DAO, Decentraland DAO
