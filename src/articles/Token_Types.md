# 1. Token types
## 1.1 Equity tokens
Represent ownership. Participants get equity tokens in exchange of a scarce resource required by the Web3 system. Capital, customers, developers, creators, etc. are examples of scarce resources generally required by Web3 systems.
## 1.2 Utility tokens 
Used to execute some use cases within an ecosystem. In other words, these tokens allow users to perform some actions on a certain decentralized system. They are a good way to access specific functionality in the application for certain users.
## 1.3 Governance tokens
During the initial phase, the development team holds great control over the application. Once the system is matured and close to completion, the development team progressively hands over the application control to the community. A fully decentralized application is maintained completely by a decentralized community. Usage examples:
- Voting on fees
- Making changes to the design proposals
- Reimbursement of transaction fees
- Treasury decisions/Incentivization
- Revisions in developer funds

An important consideration to be aware of is that governments around the world may consider your token a security, and therefore subject to regulation and tax. 
The security status of your token is determined by the [Howey test](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/howey-test.asp), which states that if your token has reasonable expectation of profits derived from the efforts of others, it may be considered a security.

# 2. Token models
## 2.1 Inflationary model
Inflationary mechanisms adds token into the overall supply to incentivize use cases behind the project like:
- Staking
- Liquidity provision
- Community rewards
- Marketing airdrops
- Bug bounties
  
## 2.2 Deflationary model
Deflationary mechanisms remove token from supply to increase token value for tokenholders and speculators, for example by:
- Buyback burning
- Transactional burning
- Reserve burning
