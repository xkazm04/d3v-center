# Tokenomics
The word "tokenomics" is as catchy as it is vaguely defined. Operationally, it is an all-encompassing term to include all of the following design categories:

- Initial supply and allocation to team, investors, community, and other stakeholders
- Methods of distribution including token purchases, airdrops, grants, and partnerships
- Revenue split between users, service providers, and protocol
- Treasury size, structure, and intended uses
- Emission schedule including inflation, mint/burn rights, and supply caps
- Coin governance including voting, escrow, stake-weighting, vesting, and gauges
- Miner and validator compensation such as fees, emissions, and penalties
- Usage of protocol’s native tokens versus external tokens (e.g. ETH, USDC)

## Why it is important?
Projects can use blockchain technology to create micro-economies. They need to decipher how tokens should work within their ecosystem to become self-sustaining.

When it comes to tokens, there is no such thing as a “one size fits all” attitude.Blockchain has opened the door to a wide range of applications and implementations.

Tokenomics allows teams to design a new model or adapt an existing one that fits with what the project aims to achieve. If done well, this can create a stable and high functioning platform.

## Common pitfalls
- No incentive to hold the token
- Low initial float
- Mismatch between buy and sell flows
- Airdropping instead of incentivizing
  
## Principles

**Ability to deliver common goods**
A good design should solve collective action problems, organizing and incentivizing its participants to provide services collectively that could not be generated from individual behavior.

**Align Rewards with Value Creation**
Ability to compensate individuals proportional to the value created. Good design generates a clear and salient link between actions and rewards to maximize incentives to create value.
