# Token vesting

Tokens are notably much more liquid than traditional equity, so founders tend to align incentives by implementing a lockup on the tokens that begins after they are generated/distributed. These lockups can range anywhere between 0 days and several years.

There are two initial types of lockup events
- **time-based** vest begins at some agreed upon date, either on the date an agreement is executed or a set period of time following the execution of an agreement. 
- **trigger-based** vesting schedule is kicked off after some event. Typically this involves a token generation event, but it can also involve a mainnet launch or the listing of a project token on a prominent exchange. 

*Around 70% of token vesting schedules were trigger-based and of those, 65% began after a token generation event.*

## Cliff
A cliff is a period of time before any tokens are distributed. Cliff lengths in crypto can range from being non-existent to over a year.

## Stats
**Avg vest schedule in 2022**
- Cliff: 0.65 YEARS
- Vesting length: 2.3 YEARS


## Optimal vesting
- Most commonly, lockup periods for a minimum of 1-year after a token launch so that both team members and investors don't immediately sell tokens
- For specific date vests, 6-month cliffs are preferable to 1-year, or no cliffs
- Larger initial unlocks have less negative price impact than smaller initial unlocks
- Longer gaps between unlocks (up to 6 months), larger unlocks, and shorter total lockup periods show better ‘worst returns’ than shorter gaps, smaller unlocks, and longer lockup periods
- Linear vesting schedules have lower volatility over the vesting period than specific date vesting schedules
- Linear vests also showed better impact on price following the initial unlock event than specific date vests
