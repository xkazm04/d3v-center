# DAO Lunch

## Benefits of DAO
- They are trustless. You don’t need to trust a CEO or management team
- It can’t be shut down unless a majority of the token holders agree. Since it is not a centralized organization, it can’t be shut down by the government (in theory).
- It is fully democratized
- It is open-source and fully transparent.

## Disadvantages of DAO
- Vulnerable to bugs in their code
- No business secrets - everything is transparent
